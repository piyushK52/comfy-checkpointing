NOTE: This code has been adapted from [Workflow Checkpointing](https://github.com/AustinMroz/ComfyUI-WorkflowCheckpointing)

# ComfyUI-WorkflowCheckpointing
Automatically creates checkpoints during workflow execution. If If an workflow is canceled or ComfyUI crashes mid-execution, then these checkpoints are used when the workflow is re-queued to resume execution with minimal progress loss.
